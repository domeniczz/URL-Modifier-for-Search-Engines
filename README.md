# URL-Modifier-for-Search-Engines
Tampermonkey Script.

Modify URLs in the search result of search engines, redirect the URL to alternatives sites or just do some other useful modification.

URL modification uses RegEx.

Current supports:

- [SearXNG](https://searx.space/) instances
- [StartPage](https://www.startpage.com)
- [Brave](https://search.brave.com)
- [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduck)

Built-in redirection:

- Reddit -> Old Reddit
- Wikipedia -> Wikiwand
- Medium -> Freedium
- ArXiv PDF -> ArXiv Abstract
- ...

You can add custom redirection rules into the script yourself.

TODOs:

1. Add supports for more search engines.
2. Refactor the code to make it easier to read and modify.
